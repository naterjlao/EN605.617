# Module 9 Thrust Library

## Building
Run `make` to compile the `main` executable.

## Usage
The following syntax is used to execute `main`.
```
./main <VECTOR_SIZE> <ITERATIONS>
```
Where:
- `VECTOR_SIZE`: Size of the input vectors
- `ITERATIONS`: Number of Iterations to perform

The time measurements for Thrust Math Operations are printed in this order:
VECTOR_SIZE,ITERATIONS,TIME (in milliseconds)

## Validation and Metrics
The `run.sh` will run compile the `main` binaries and run trial tests.
