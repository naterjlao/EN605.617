# Module 7 Serial vs Async Memory Operations

## Building
Run `make` to compile the `main` executable.

## Usage
The following syntax is used to execute `main`.
```
./main <THREADS> <BLOCK_SIZE>
```
Where:
- `THREADS`: Number of Threads
- `BLOCK_SIZE`: Number of Blocks

The time measurements for Serial and Asynchronous Memory Operations are
printed (in order) to stdout.

## Validation and Metrics
The `run.sh` will run compile the `main` binaries and run trial tests.
